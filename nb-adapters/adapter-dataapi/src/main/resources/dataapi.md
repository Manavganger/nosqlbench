# Data API adapter

This is a NB adapter for the [Data API](https://github.com/stargate/data-api), an HTTP API that can run on top of Cassandra and DataStax Astra DB.

The adapter is built on top of the [Java client](https://github.com/datastax/astra-db-java) for the Data API and exposes the same primitives as the Data API, in a 1:1 relation between ops and Data API commands wherever possible and exposing all of the command options when it makes sense to do so.

## Command-line parameters

_Note: this release of the adapter is designed to connect to **DataStax Astra DB's Data API** specifically. All examples refer to this case. Subsequent releases will expand the scope to non-Astra-DB instances of Data API._

Connection to the Data API requires an **API Endpoint** and an **Application Token**, plus specification of a **keyspace** to operate in. These are required parameters when launching a NB workload targeting the Data API:

```
astraToken="..."
astraApiEndpoint="https://..."
namespace="the_keyspace"
```

These values are used by the adapter to establish a `DataAPIClient`, from which all subsequent operations are spawned.

## Legacy vs. "new-style" operation

In September 2026, a major rework of the ops has been initiated, essentially marking all operations existing so far as "legacy" and introducing a whole new set of ops, coming with more extensible naming conventions (e.g. the legacy `find` op has become `collection_find`). The overhaul has reached its first milestone (collection CRUD and all collection operations).

The legacy operations received bug fixes (plus obvious additive extensions to their behaviour when it made sense to). So, no pre-existing workload will break. However, the user is encouraged to build new workload exclusively using the new-style operations.

For a detailed catalog of the legacy and the new-style operations, with their syntax, consult the "Examples" section below.

### Current status of the overhaul

**Done:**

- All collection DML ops;
- Create/delete collection DDL;
- All known bugs in legacy operations are fixed;
- **Table support** (partial, see below).

**Coming next:**

- Administrative functions (create keyspace and so on), currently left as they were before the overhaul;
- Ability to target non-Astra and non-prod environments in full;
- Ability to supply special Data API-related secrets (such as embedding provider API keys for `$vectorize` operations).
- User Defined Type (UDT) and table index operations support for tables. 

## Table support

This release introduces partial support for **Data API Tables**. Tables are the schemaed counterpart to the schemaless collection.

> Note: We say partial support because table support only can perform CRUD operations for now. UDT and index functionality soon to come!

### New table DDL ops

| Op name | Description |
|---|---|
| `db_create_table` | Create a table with a given schema |
| `db_drop_table` | Drop a table |
| `db_list_tables` | List tables |
| `db_list_table_names` | List table names only |
| `table_create_vector_index` | Create a vector index on a table column (allows searching on non-partition key columns) |

> Note: more index features soon to come. Only table_create_vector_index is supported for now. 

### New table DML ops

| Op name | Description |
|---|---|
| `table_insert_one` | Insert a single row |
| `table_insert_many` | Insert multiple rows |
| `table_find` | Find rows matching a filter |
| `table_find_one` | Find the first row matching a filter |
| `table_update_one` | Update the first row matching a filter |
| `table_delete_one` | Delete the first row matching a filter |
| `table_delete_many` | Delete all rows matching a filter |

### Code organisation

All table related op dispensers live under the `opdispensers/tables/` subdir and their corresponding op implementations under `ops/tables/`. Likewise, collection ops have been moved into the `opdispensers/collections/` and `ops/collections/` subdirs to keep the codebase cleaner.

### Reference workload

A comprehensive table workload covering all ops is available at [`activities/table_mega_test.yaml`](activities/table_mega_test.yaml). You can run this workload with the following:

```bash
$ java -jar nb5.jar \
  nb-adapters/adapter-dataapi/src/main/resources/activities/table_mega_test.yaml \
  megatest \
  astraApiEndpoint=$ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT \
  astraToken=$ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN \
  namespace=default_keyspace \
  --log-level-override com.datastax.astra.client:DEBUG
```

## Usage notes (new-style ops)

Most commands support a free-form syntax for some of their parameters, such as the collection definition for `db_create_collection` or the insertee document in `collection_insert_one`. This is to give the most flexibility and future-proofing the op in case new syntax is added by the Data API.

In other cases, when it was deemed more convenient, the syntax is more constrained. All specifications are given in the supporting example op YAMLs under `activities/`.

### Vectors

Many commands allow to supply **vectors**: these can be expressed in the YAML:

- literally, as lists of (floating-point) numbers: `[0.1,-3.2,1.9]`;
- literally, as a string containing comma-separated floating points: `"0.1,-3.2,1.9"`;
- via an appropriate binding, e.g. `"{the_vector_binding}"`.

In any case, whenever the API Client is equipped to do so, vectors are transmitted in the bandwidth-optimized binary-encoded form regardless of how they are given. One _should not_ manually construct the binary-encoding syntax (e.g. as part of an insertee document for a `collection_insert_one` op).

## Client vs. 'raw Data API payloads'

An important virtue of the Java Data API client is that it handles headers, authentication, encoding/decoding of payloads and responses - with minimal overhead.

On the other hand, the client builds higher-level convenience features on top of the raw HTTP requests underlying the API: so, for example, what for the client is a single 200-item `insertMany(...)` invocation translates to a certain number of "chunked" Data API requests, each one inserting some of the items and executed with a degree of (client-managed) concurrency that depends on various settings. _This is a kind of sophistication that a typical usage of NB would not want_.

For this reason, the adapter strives to avoid patterns that would trigger such "too complex" behaviours: for instance, the client concurrency for multiple insertions is always hardcoded to one, leaving management of concurrent requests purely on the NB side.

It is, however, an ultimate responsibility of the Data API-savvy NB user to ensure full compliance with this tenet, for example never packing more than a pageful of items into a `collection_insert_many` operation's `documents` property.
